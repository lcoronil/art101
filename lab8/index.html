	<h1>Lab 8: Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>
	<h2> Challenges </h2>
	<p>The challenge here was creating a named function and making it do a calculation correctly.
  I didn't really understand at first but after some time and research I figured out that I wasn't typing the operation correctly.</p>
	<h2>Problems</h2>
	<p>The only problems were writing a named function, the anon function was easier for me to understand.<p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p>The results should appear in the console.log and should look like this!</p>
