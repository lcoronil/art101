  	<h2> Challenges </h2>
  	<p>I tried to understand the jQuery library but I am still lost on how to make the
    buttons and labels and what it's supposed to look like when you toggle class special.
    I tried my best to understand but it's really confusing and I am tired.</p>
    <!-- Create button -->
      <button class="button-1">
      Button 1
      </button>
    <!-- div special -->
      <div id="special">
        Beep
        </div>
      </div>

    <div id="problems">
  	<h2>Problems</h2>
  	<p>This isn't my best work because I wasn't able to finish but the problems I encountered
    was mostly just a lack of understanding how to write in the jQuery format and how to make
    buttons. I feel like the instructions confused me too and looking at the lecture slides
    helped but weren't enough.</p>
    <!-- create button -->
      <button class="button-2">
        Button 2

    <!-- div special -->

        Boop
        </div>
      </div>

    <div id="results">
  	<h2>Results</h2>
  	<p>I have no idea what the result is supposed to look like I'm sorry.</p>
    <!-- create button -->
    <button class="button-3">
      Button 3
      </button>
    <!-- div special -->
