  	<h1>Lab 9: JavaScript for the Web</h1>
  	<h2> Challenges </h2>
  	<p>The most challenging part of this lab was getting the appendChild to work and
    getting the output to show on the page.</p>
  	<h2>Problems</h2>
  	<p>Problems that we faces was being unable to get appendChild to work, and it took some
      time before I realized later that I was using that function wrong. Another problem was
      getting the output to show but that's because I had an issue in the index.html file.<p>
  	<h2>Results</h2>
  	<p>The results are shown below!</p>
