  	<h1>Lab 12: Conditionals</h1>
  	<h2> Challenges </h2>
  	<p>There wasn't much challenge besides writing the button in the index html and
    using the event listener in the javascript file</p>
  	<h2>Problems</h2>
  	<p>No problems occurred for the sortingHat function but I am trying to implement an array
      instead of a function and have been having a bit of trouble with that. I'm not sure how
      to implement the mod as the index there.<p>
