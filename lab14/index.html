  	<h1>Lab 14: Debugging Tools & Strategies</h1>
  	<h2> Challenges </h2>
  	<p>It wasn't a very challenging lab, mostly tedious because we were going through
    all of our previous labs and very carefully tried to find the one error in our code.</p>
  	<h2>Problems</h2>
  	<p>The main problem we were having was that we had the same code but for some reason the code
      only worked on my browser and not my partner's. It was really strange because we had pretty
      much the exact same thing and we went through it line by line and she kept getting errors on it
      while I didn't get any. We had to google help but even then the solutions only worked for me and not my partner's.<p>
  	<h2>Results</h2>
  	<p>The results of our debugging is in our resubmissions :D</p>
