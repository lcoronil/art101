  	<h1>Lab 10: JavaScript Events and Forms</h1>
  	<h2> Challenges </h2>
  	<p>I wasn't able to find a partner for this project and had so much going on this week
    it was difficult to find time to do this lab. I was already late so I just decided to do this lab on my own.
    It was a difficult lab because I was having trouble getting the script output to show, but I eventually figured
    it out with the help of W3Schools.</p>
  	<h2>Problems</h2>
  	<p>I was having a lot of problems with the code for getting the script output, and had trouble getting the input
    value to get accepted from the browser. I had to look back at the lecture slides for the .value and then it worked.
    I'm not entirely sure if I coded the script output correctly because the directions confused me, but since it works
    I think it's good.<p>
  	<h2>Results</h2>
  	<p>I used my NameSort function from lab 7 so it takes the input of your name and sorts the characters in alphabetical
    order. Put your name in the textbox and try it out!</p>
    <h3> Script Output </h3>
    <div id="output">
    <form>
      <label for="user-name">Input your name:</label><br>
      <input type="text" id="user-name" name="user-name"><br>
    </form>
    <button id='my-button'>Click Me</button>
  </div>
