	<h1>Lab 7: Functions</h1>
	<h2> Challenges </h2>
	<p>The most challenging thing for me was getting the output, it wasn't working for a while.
  But then I realized it was because of minor spelling mistakes so it's okay now.</p>
	<h2>Problems</h2>
	<p>Getting the function to properly print took a while for me but overall no problems<p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p>Type in your user and watch the letters get sorted!</p>

  <h3> Script Output </h3>
