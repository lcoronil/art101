  	<h1>Lab 15: AJAX</h1>
  	<h2> Challenges </h2>
  	<p>I was able to get the API endpoint, but don't really understand how to use AJAX. Even when googling
    and using the lecture for help I still don't really understand how it works and I am not sure how to write the code
    for it.</p>
  	<h2>Problems</h2>
  	<p>I got up to the part where I have to make the API output using AJAX and I don't really get it. My partner and I
    were both struggling to understand and overall haven't been able to get it to work.<p>
  	<h2>Results</h2>
  	<p>I didn't get to finish so there's no output to show.</p>
    <h3> Script Output </h3>
