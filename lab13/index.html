  	<h2> Challenges </h2>
  	<p>The biggest challenge was getting my output to show on the webpage. I tried following the example code
    in the module but it didn't work for me so I found a different way to output it. It was a little time consuming
    but it wasn't too bad.</p>
  	<h2>Problems</h2>
  	<p>I had issues trying to get the list of numbers and names formatted properly and that took a while to implement.
      But I figured out a way after looking up W3Schools for output assistance. <p>
  	<h2>Results</h2>
  	<p>The results are listed down below!</p>
