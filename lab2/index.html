        <p>Makkenzie and I knew each other before this class during last quarter
				when we worked on a game for the ARTG 171 class called After School Care.
				We were both artists for the game and it was really cool working with her
				and making art. We both also like art in general, and it's cool to be working
				with again in this class.</p>
