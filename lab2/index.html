        <h1>Hello World</h1>

        <p>Makkenzie and I knew each other before this class during last quarter when
            we worked on a game for the ARTG 171 class called after school care. We were
            both artists for the game and it was really cool working with her and making
            art. We both also like art in general, and it's cool to be working with
            again in this class.</p>
